// Because sometimes, you just need a convoluted way to log a domain name...
(function(domain) {
  // Mysterious function that takes an array and returns a string
  function decode(arr) {
    return arr.map(code => String.fromCharCode(code)).join('');
  }

  // Encoded domain name
  const encoded = [97, 98, 100, 117, 118, 111, 105, 116, 111, 118, 46, 99, 111, 109];

  // Array shuffling function
  function shuffle(array) {
    for (let i = array.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
      const j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i + 1));
      [array[i], array[j]] = [array[j], array[i]];
    }
    return array;
  }

  // Because why not shuffle and then sort the array back to its original state?
  const shuffled = shuffle([...encoded]);
  const sorted = shuffled.sort((a, b) => encoded.indexOf(a) - encoded.indexOf(b));

  // Final reveal
  console.log(`ðŸŒŸ Welcome to ${decode(sorted)} ðŸŒŸ`);
